# cs537-proj4
a special version of the malloc and free library routines that checks on common heap allocation and usage mistakes. This version of malloc and free is called malloc537 and free537.  It also has one extra function, memcheck537, for checking if a heap allocated memory address range is safe to use.  A programmer will use these versions of malloc and free wherever they would use the real ones.  malloc537 and free537 will first check to see operation is safe and makes sense, and then call the real malloc or free to get the job done. In addition, whenever your program needs to access heap memory, they will insert a extra call to memcheck537 into their code to verify if that address range is valid.
